# Machine Health
A Study project that create a app to predict a probability of having diabetes with Machine Learning. The machine learning model was developed using [GradienteBoosting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html). The NodeJS was used to create the app.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.
